# Week2
Building on Week 1, I expanded the visual analysis by incorporating additional insights. I introduced a Pie Chart to highlight the top 3 districts by production and a Tree Map to analyze production trends by crop year. To enhance forecasting, I implemented a Line Chart for production prediction, offering a year-wise trend analysis. Additionally, a Donut Chart was used to assess production by season while refining filters for more accurate insights. These improvements provide a deeper, more structured understanding of agricultural data.
